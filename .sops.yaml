# 1) Edit secrets with your admin SSH key (loaded from .config on main desktop):
#      sops secrets/mail2discord.yaml
#
# 2) Or tell sops to use a host's generated key:
#      export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt
#
# 2b) Now you can edit/decrypt, e.g.:
#      sops secrets/mail2discord.yaml
#      sops secrets/cloudflare.env
